The Marconi Magnetic Detector operates on the principles of electromagnetic induction. It detects radio waves by utilizing a coherer, which is a component sensitive to electromagnetic waves.  It operates by utilizing an antenna to receive radio waves, a coherer to detect and respond to these waves by altering its electrical resistance, and subsequent circuitry that interprets this change to generate a discernible output, usually an audible signal.

The changing electromagnetic field from the microwaves will make charged particles move, and so the electrons in the metal legs will move creating current. This current makes the lamps glow.

Bandwidth is intimately linked to the efficiency, capacity, and quality of radio wave-based communication systems.  By managing bandwidth allocation and optimizing transmission parameters, engineers can design communication networks that deliver reliable, high-speed connectivity to users worldwide. Somewhere above you right now, a plane is broadcasting its location, speed and bearing on 1090 MHz.  A geostationary weather satellite 22 thousand miles from Earth is transmitting detailed weather maps on 1694.1 MHz.  A car driving by your home is transmitting a signal with the pressure readout of one of its tires at 315MHz.  A GPS satellite flying overhead at 8,000 miles per hour is pinging a signal to your phone at 1575.42 MHz .  A data buoy bobbing in the Atlantic ocean transmits sea temperature, wave height and wind speed readings to a NOAA satellite at 401 MHz.  On top of all that, every single mobile device and WiFi router near you blasts out everyone’s internet traffic through the air over radio waves.  All of these can occur simultaneously thanks to a very carefully regulated radio spectrum.  Licensed broadcasters may be assigned portions of the regionally available bandwidth so that their signals do not interfere with each other. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share the task of managing the allotment of radio frequencies for U.S. airwaves.

Higher energy machines – In 1937, the Westinghouse Electric company built a 65 ft (20 m) machine, the Westinghouse Atom Smasher capable of generating 5 MeV in Forest Hills, Pennsylvania.  It marked the beginning of nuclear research for civilian applications.  It was decommissioned in 1958 and was partially demolished in 2015.",

      "While the telephone, invented in the late 19th century, revolutionized direct communication between individuals, it was limited by the need for physical connection via wires or cables. It facilitated one-on-one conversations over long distances but didn't address the challenge of capturing and transmitting distant sounds or voices for broader audiences. The audio translator enabled the conversion of sound waves into electrical signals, allowing the transmission of these signals over vast distances without degradation. This technology facilitated the broadcast of sounds—music, speeches, news—to a wide audience, overcoming the limitations of direct communication offered by the telephone. It enabled shared experiences and cultural exchange on a mass scale, reaching millions of households globally.",

    how: "An audio translator works by capturing sound waves through a sensitive microphone or diaphragm. These sound waves are then converted into electrical signals. This transformation allows the signals to be amplified, transmitted, and reproduced as sound at a receiving end. Essentially, it converts audible information into electrical impulses for efficient transmission across distances, ensuring that the original sounds remain intact when they reach their destination.
